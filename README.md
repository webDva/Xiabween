# Xiabween
Xiabween is a free and open source RPG video game.

I will create instructions on how to compile Xiabween before the pre-Alpha release on October 31, 2015. Hopefully, Gradle and Eclipse won't be too difficult to work with together.

# Technical Details
Xiabween is made in Java using the libGDX game engine.

The primary logic source code is located in core/src.
