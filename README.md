# Xiabween
Xiabween is a free and open source 2D action battle game in early development. For more information about Xiabween, such as my plans for it, you can visit my development journal, http://xiabween.blogspot.com/.

I will create instructions on how to compile Xiabween before the pre-Alpha release on October 31, 2015. Hopefully, Gradle and Eclipse won't be too difficult to work with together.

# Technical Details
Xiabween is made in Java using the libGDX game engine.

The primary logic source code is located in core/src.
